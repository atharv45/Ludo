# Ludo

It is a beginner-friendly game inspired by Ludo! 🕹️ My game takes players on a journey from 0 to victory with just two players, each controlling a single piece. The gameplay involves rolling a dice to determine the moves, and if a player is on a safe spot, they're secure, but if not, they get "killed" and restart from the beginning.
